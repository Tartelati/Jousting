# High Score System Overview

## Current Implementation

The Joust remake currently includes a basic high score system implemented in `scripts/managers/score_manager.gd`. This system provides:

### Existing Features
- **Basic Score Tracking**: Real-time score updates for up to 4 players
- **Life Management**: Player lives with bonus life awards every 1000 points
- **Simple Persistence**: High scores saved to `user://high_scores.save`
- **Developer Easter Egg**: Permanent top score for "David Lacassagne"
- **Bonus Scoring**: Special point awards for skilled gameplay (air catches, etc.)

### Current Limitations
- Limited error handling for file operations
- No player name validation or sanitization
- Basic UI for high score entry
- No backup or recovery mechanisms
- Fixed configuration (max 10 scores, hardcoded paths)
- No data migration support for future updates

## Planned Enhancements

A comprehensive enhancement to the high score system is currently specified in `.kiro/specs/high-score-save-system/`. This enhancement will address the current limitations and add robust features:

### New Architecture Components

#### HighScoreStorage Class
- **Robust File Operations**: Enhanced save/load with error handling
- **Backup System**: Automatic backup creation and corruption recovery

- **Name Sanitization**: Clean and validate player names (max 20 chars)
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation of high score entries
- **Security**: Protection against data manipulation

#### Enhanced ScoreManager
- **Event System**: Signals for UI feedback and notifications
- **Multi-player Support**: Independent tracking for simultaneous players
- **Configuration**: Customizable limits and behavior
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when storage fails

### User Experience Improvements
