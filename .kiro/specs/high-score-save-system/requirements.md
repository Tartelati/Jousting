# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive high score save system for the Joust remake multiplayer game. The system will persist high scores to local storage, allowing players to track their best performances across game sessions. The system builds upon the existing ScoreManager implementation while adding robust data persistence, validation, and enhanced user experience features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want my high scores to be automatically saved when I achieve them, so that I can see my progress over time and compete with previous sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player achieves a score that qualifies for the high score list THEN the system SHALL automatically save the score to persistent storage
2. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL load previously saved high scores from storage
3. WHEN a high score is saved THEN the system SHALL validate the data integrity before writing to storage
4. WHEN storage is unavailable or corrupted THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and continue with default high scores

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to enter my name when I achieve a high score, so that I can be properly credited for my achievement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player achieves a qualifying high score THEN the system SHALL prompt for name entry
2. WHEN a player enters a name THEN the system SHALL validate the name meets length and character requirements
3. WHEN a player submits an empty name THEN the system SHALL use a default name like "Anonymous"
4. WHEN a player enters a name longer than 20 characters THEN the system SHALL truncate it to 20 characters
5. WHEN a player enters invalid characters THEN the system SHALL filter them out and keep only alphanumeric characters and spaces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see the high score list displayed in the game, so that I can see how my performance compares to previous games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the high score list THEN the system SHALL display scores in descending order
2. WHEN viewing the high score list THEN the system SHALL show player name, score, and date achieved
3. WHEN viewing the high score list THEN the system SHALL highlight the current session's scores differently
4. WHEN the high score list is empty THEN the system SHALL display appropriate placeholder text
5. WHEN displaying scores THEN the system SHALL format numbers with appropriate separators (e.g., 1,000,000)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the high score system to handle multiple players in a single session, so that each player's achievements are properly tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple players are active THEN the system SHALL track each player's score independently
2. WHEN any player achieves a high score THEN the system SHALL prompt only that player for name entry
3. WHEN multiple players achieve high scores in the same session THEN the system SHALL handle each submission separately
4. WHEN a player already has a score in the high score list THEN the system SHALL update their entry if the new score is higher

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the save system to be robust and handle edge cases gracefully, so that players never lose their high score data due to technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the save file becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL create a backup and restore from it if available
2. WHEN disk space is insufficient THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and continue without saving
3. WHEN file permissions prevent writing THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with in-memory high scores
4. WHEN the system detects impossible scores (negative or extremely high) THEN it SHALL reject them and log the attempt
5. WHEN saving fails multiple times THEN the system SHALL disable automatic saving and notify the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want my high scores to persist across game updates and reinstalls, so that I don't lose my achievements when the game is updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is updated THEN the system SHALL preserve existing high score data
2. WHEN the save file format changes THEN the system SHALL migrate old data to the new format
3. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL preserve the original file as a backup
4. WHEN the user data directory is moved THEN the system SHALL attempt to locate the save file in common locations
5. WHEN no save file is found THEN the system SHALL start with default high scores including the developer entry

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the high score system to provide feedback when scores are saved, so that I know my achievements have been recorded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a high score is successfully saved THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
2. WHEN saving fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message explaining the issue
3. WHEN a new personal best is achieved THEN the system SHALL highlight this achievement
4. WHEN a score doesn't qualify for the high score list THEN the system SHALL still acknowledge the player's performance
5. WHEN the high score list is updated THEN the system SHALL animate the changes to draw attention

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the save system to be configurable, so that I can adjust settings like maximum number of high scores stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL read configuration settings from a settings file
2. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults
3. WHEN the maximum high score count is configured THEN the system SHALL respect this limit
4. WHEN the save file location is configured THEN the system SHALL use the specified path
5. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging of save operations
