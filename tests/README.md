## Integration with ScoreManager

The HighScoreValidator is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing ScoreManager:

```gdscript
# In ScoreManager
var validator = HighScoreValidator.new()

func submit_high_score(player_index: int, player_name: String) -> bool:
    var score = get_score(player_index)
    var result = validator.validate_score_submission(player_name, score, player_index)
    
    if result.valid:
        # Use sanitized data
        var clean_name = result.sanitized_data.name
        var clean_score = result.sanitized_data.score
        # Proceed with saving...
        return true
    else:
        # Handle validation errors
        for error in result.errors:
            print("Validation error: ", error)
        return false
```

The HighScoreStorage can be integrated with the ScoreManager as follows:

```gdscript
# In ScoreManager
var storage: HighScoreStorage

func _ready():
    # Initialize storage with configuration
    var config = {
        "save_location": "user://high_scores.save",
        "backup_enabled": true,
        "debug_logging": false
    }
    storage = HighScoreStorage.new(config)
    
    # Load existing high scores
    high_scores = storage.load_high_scores()

func save_high_scores():
    var save_result = storage.save_high_scores(high_scores)
    if save_result != HighScoreStorage.StorageError.SUCCESS:
        print("Failed to save high scores: ", save_result)
        # Handle error appropriately - storage will attempt backup recovery
        
func handle_storage_error(error: HighScoreStorage.StorageError):
    match error:
        HighScoreStorage.StorageError.DISK_FULL:
            show_error_message("Disk full - unable to save high scores")
        HighScoreStorage.StorageError.PERMISSION_DENIED:
            show_error_message("Permission denied - check file permissions")
        HighScoreStorage.StorageError.CORRUPTION_DETECTED:
            show_error_message("Save file corrupted - attempting recovery")
        _:
            show_error_message("Unknown storage error occurred")
```

    print("Score saved! Rank: %d" % result.rank)
    if result.is_personal_best:
        print("New personal best!")
else:
    print("Save failed: %s" % result.message)

# Get formatted scores for display
var formatted_scores = ScoreManager.get_formatted_high_scores()
for entry in formatted_scores:
    print("%d. %s - %s" % [entry.rank, entry.name, entry.formatted_score])
    if entry.is_current_session:
        print("  (Current Session)")
```

The enhanced ScoreManager maintains full backward compatibility while providing robust new features for high score management.
